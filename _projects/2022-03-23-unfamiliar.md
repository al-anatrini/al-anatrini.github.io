## Short description

"Unfamiliar walks" 1 and 2 have been composed in the context of “Healing Environments” a collaborative project between the Hochschule für Musik und Theater Hamburg, Universitätsklinikum Eppendonrf and the Medical School Hamburg. In this project it has been addressed the question as to how interventions via interactive, generative music systems may contribute to the improvement of the atmosphere and thus to the well-being of patients in hospital waiting and emergency rooms. The project was conducted both by students and faculties of the music therapy and multimedia composition programs and has thus offered rare insights into the dynamic of such undertakings, covering both the therapeutic underpinnings as well as the technical means required to achieve a particular result. 
The piece of each composer is arranged on five different presets that could be freely selected by the patients through an iPad installed in the different rooms.
My role for this project, in addition to program two sets of pieces, consisted in re-design the engine that hosts the samples, now part of the Maxscore suite, and develope the graphic user interface.
