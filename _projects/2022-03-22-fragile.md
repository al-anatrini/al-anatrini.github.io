## Program notes

The title of the piece refers to a basic unsteadiness and ultimately to an irreducibility of the musical sign which tries to outline a map of this territory. The A of the 1st oboe, at the very beginning of the piece ideally represents our compass: by studying the composition of its spectral features was deduced the entire music material of the piece. This territory, always on the edge of the implosion, is not as much a musical rationalisation of a process of discovery but rather its revelation through a serie of epiphanic events which like a light bulb are turned on, showing us a wider passage of our journey. From each of these events arises constellations of vibrations, a matter which keeps an undefined resonance of its origins - accents and traces which come from the physicality of the body, - and like every living creature are unstable and fragile.
