Recording of the live performance at Miralles-Saal, Hamburg.


_Fragile territories_ was commissioned by Hamburger Symphoniker for the 2016/17 season.
The entire music material of the piece emanates from the spectral components of the A of the oboe at the beginning of the piece. 
A territory unveiled through a serie of epiphanic events which like a light bulb are turned on. From each of these arises constellations of vibrations, a matter which keeps an undefined resonance of its origins - accents and traces which come from the physicality of the body, - and like every living creature are unstable and fragile.
