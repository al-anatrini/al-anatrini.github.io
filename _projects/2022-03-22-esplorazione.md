## Program notes

Esplorazione di una certa quantità d'acqua (Exploration of a certain quantity of water) is an attempt to give an answer to the question: how a non-musical element (water) can condition the music material? All over the piuece the sound is sculpted by the resonance of the water, a constant drift towards distorsion, interference, unbearable density and its contrary.



## Recording
