On the left an excerpt of the score. On the right a snippet of the control panel of the max patch. In the max patch a matrix object is used to dinamically route the signal of the contrabassoon's microphone to the different effects modules visible on the right side of the cover image. The piece is arranged into cues, any of those corresponding to different routing settings.
