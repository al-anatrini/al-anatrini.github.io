## Short description

Generative and interactive installation presented at Blurred Edges Festival in 2020. The system acts as a sequence of intermezzos that automatically turn on during the pause between a piece and the next one, therefore it is meant to be used in 'classic' concert scenarios.

## Program notes

"Here be dragons" means unexplored and/or dangerous territories. It is horror vacui and represents the necessity of filling a space, actually two: that where the listener is situated, and the metaphorically empty one between a piece and the next one. "Here be dragons" is part of an ecosystem tailored on the physical space and fed by whoever temporarily inhabits that territory. What happens in the room is captured through a microphone and transformed into data that are misteriously reflected in a sonic world that is unpredictable and unable of repeating itself. "Here be dragons" has a beginning but not an end and it does not require your attention. You can keep talking to your neighbour, listen in religious silence, scroll on the phone or try to communicate with the system...
