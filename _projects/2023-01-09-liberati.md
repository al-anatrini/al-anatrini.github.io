_Liberati di tutto_ is a short audio video performance created for the Innovative Hochschule Days and presented in the Forum of the Hochschule für Musik und Theater Hamburg.

_Liberati di tutto_ (Get rid of everything) is what the voice in the background is repeating several times during the piece. There is no particular reason why I choose this specific sentence, or maybe there is but now is not relevant anymore.
My work explores the relationship between consumerist fetishism and impersonal memories. With influences as diverse as Ligeti and Aphex Twin, new combinations are distilled from both simple and complex scenarios. As temporal replicas become distorted through diligent and repetitive practice, the listener is left with a tribute to the possibilities of our culture.
If the previous sentence sounds like bullocks, is because is what it actually is. 
Stop wasting your time, drop the notes and listen!
