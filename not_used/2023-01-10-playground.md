## Short description

Studies for the interactive video of "Here is always somewhere else" (working title). 
A photogrammetric process is used in order to create 3d content from several still images of a physical environment. The 3d models are then further refined and then rendered in real time using different effects and instancing techniques. A "walk" inside the model is simulated by interpolating different camera positions.

## Program notes

The core element of this work is the passion I have always had for places or objects that seem to contain everything: maps, museums, encyclopaedias and so on. I want to build an ecosystem that already contains all the information and possible interactions with the environment in which the work is placed. The video studies presented here are part of a generative system with an adaptive behaviour to external conditions. At the basis of the work is a feedback system in which the processes of sound and image rendering are modified by the way the space and those who are in it respond to these stimuli.
The intervention involves the use of a wavefield synthesis system (WFS) and LED panels. Thirtytwo loudspeakers are hung at about 2 mts. from the ground on a truss - supported by columns - with a perimeter of about 6x11 mts. The truss is entirely covered by the loudspeakers facing the inside of the structure, while the space left free between the loudspeakers and the ground will be entirely covered by the LED panels in order to create an immersive environment.



## Images

Two images taken from the reconstructed model of a pavillon of the former psychiatric hospital in the city of Volterra in Tuscany (Italy). The hospital founded in 1888 was closed in 1978 for the effects of the Basaglia Law which enforced the closing down of all psychiatric hospitals in Italy and their replacement with a whole range of community-based services. A fictionalised version of the hospital was the set of the horror video game The Town of Light (2016).

## Recording

Six short studies of a "walk" inside different 3d-models.
For the first serie of three videos the model of the Volterra hospital is used. The second serie is based on a model of a small portion of Tiergarten Park in Berlin. This latter model has been used in order to test different instancing techniques for outdoor scearios.
