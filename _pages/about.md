I took part in festivals as a composer and computer music designer such as Manifèste, Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival, Impuls, Tempo Reale Festival and Tactus among others.
I also served as interaction designer in projects of the Universität der Künste Berlin and the Digital Stage Foundation.
