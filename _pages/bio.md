In the last years his work mainly consists in site specific installations to promote the quality of the relationship between environment-audience-intervetion of the artist, creating a place of partecipatory interaction, being aware that it is not possible to observe without transforming.
His interests include AI-based adaptive mixed media systems, phisical modeling of environments and photogrammetry techniques.
